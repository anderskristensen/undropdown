# The "undropdown" Drop Down jQuery UI Widget

A jQuery UI dropdown list widget where entries are arbitrary
JavaScript objects and the app gets to render those objects as HTML
for display in the dropdown list. This can be used to let the user
select among complex objects. The demo directory includes two such
examples: a font chooser and a palette chooser. The demos can be seen
at <http://www.unreserved.org/undropdown/>.
